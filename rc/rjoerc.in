                         Initialization file for JOE
                            Restricted access Joe

 JOE looks for this file in:
	1 - $HOME/.rjoerc
	2 - @JOERC@/rjoerc

 This file can include other files by placing the following include command
 in the first column:

 :include filename

 FIRST SECTION: Default global options (these options can also be specified
 on the command line.  Also the NOXON, LINES, COLUMNS, DOPADDING and BAUD
 options can be specified in environment variables):

 Put each color override you want in the first column.

 Valid colors:
   bold inverse blink dim underline italic
   white cyan magenta blue yellow green red black
   bg_white bg_cyan bg_magenta bg_blue bg_yellow bg_green bg_red bg_black

 Override all instances of class Idle:
   =Idle red

 Override Idle only for c syntax file:
   =c.Idle red

 The following list is from c.jsf.  Look at other syntax files for more classes.

 SECOND SECTION: File name dependant local option settings:

 Each line with '*' in the first column indicates the modes which should be
 set for files which match the regular expression.  If more than one regular
 expression matches the file name, then the last matching one is chosen.

 Here are the modes which can be set:

	-cpara >#!;*/%
				Characters which can indent paragraphs.

	-cnotpara .
				Characters which begin non-paragraph lines.


	-encoding name
				Set file coding (for example: utf-8, iso-8859-15)

	-syntax name
				Specify syntax (syntax file called
				'name.jsf' will be loaded)

	-hex			Hex editor mode

	-highlight		Enable highlighting

	-smarthome		Home key first moves cursor to beginning of line,
				then if hit again, to first non-blank character.

	-indentfirst		Smart home goes to first non-blank character first,
				instead of going the beginning of line first.

	-smartbacks		Backspace key deletes 'istep' number of
				'indentc's if cursor is at first non-space
				character.

	-tab nnn		Tab width

	-indentc nnn		Indentation character (32 for space, 9 for tab)

	-istep nnn		Number of indentation columns

	-spaces			TAB inserts spaces instead of tabs.

	-purify			Fix indentation if necessary for rindent, lindent and backs
				(for example if indentation uses a mix of tabs and spaces,
				and indentc is space, indentation will be converted to all
				spaces).

	-crlf			File uses CR-LF at ends of lines

	-wordwrap		Wordwrap

	-autoindent		Auto indent

	-overwrite		Overtype mode

        -picture                Picture mode (right arrow can go past end of lines)

	-lmargin nnn		Left margin

	-rmargin nnn		Right margin

	-flowed			Put one space after intermediate paragraph lines
				for support of flowed text.


	-french			One space after '.', '?' and '!' for wordwrap
				and paragraph reformat instead of two.  Joe
				does not change the spacing you give, but
				sometimes it must put spacing in itself.  This
				selects how much is inserted.

	-linums			Enable line numbers on each line

	-rdonly			File is read-only

	-keymap name
				Keymap to use if not 'main'

	-lmsg			Status line definition strings-
	-rmsg			see previous section for more info.

	-mfirst macro
				Macro to execute on first modification
	-mnew macro
				Macro to execute when new files are loaded
	-mold macro
				Macro to execute when existing files are loaded
	-msnew macro
				Macro to execute when new files are saved
	-msold macro
				Macro to execute when existing files are saved

	Macros for the above options are in the same format as in the key
	binding section below- but without the key name strings.

	These define the language syntax for ^G (goto matching delimiter):

	-highlighter_context	Use the highlighter context for ^G

	-single_quoted		Text between '  ' should be ignored (this is
				not good for regular text since ' is
				normally used alone as an apostrophe)

	-c_comment		Text between /* */ should be ignored

	-cpp_comment		Text after // should be ignored

	-pound_comment		Text after # should be ignored

	-vhdl_comment		Text after -- should be ignored

	-semi_comment		Text after ; should be ignored

	-text_delimiters begin=end:if=elif=else=endif

				Define word delimiters

 Default local options
-highlight
-istep 4

 Use this macro (put in first column) to have joe "p4 edit" a file you're about to change.

 -mfirst if,"rdonly && joe(sys,\"p4 edit \",name,rtn)",then,mode,"o",msg,"executed \"p4 edit ",name,"\"",rtn,endif

 File type table is now in a separate file.  You can copy this file to ~/.joe and customize it.

:include ftyperc

 SECOND and 1/2 SECTION: Option menu layout

	:defmenu name	Defines a menu.

	macro string comment
			A menu entry.  Macro is any JOE macro- see "Macros:"
			below. String is the label to be used for the macro
			in the menu.  It is in the same format as the -lmsg
			and -rmsg options above.

			Two whitespace characters in a row begins a comment.
			Use '% ' for a leading space in the string.

 FOURTH SECTION: Key bindings:

 Section names you must provide:

	:main		For editing window
	:prompt		For prompt lines
	:query		For single-character query lines
	:querya		Singe-character query for quote
	:querysr	Search & Replace single-character query
	:shell		For shell windows

 Other sections may be given as well for organization purposes or for
 use with the '-keymap' option.

 Use:
 :inherit name		To copy the named section into the current one
 :delete key		To delete a key sequence from the current section

 Keys:

 Use ^@ through ^_, ^# and ^? for Ctrl chars
 Use SP for space
 Use a TO b to generate a range of characters
 Use MDOWN, MDRAG, MUP, M2DOWN, M2DRAG, M2UP, M3DOWN, M3DRAG, M3UP for mouse
 Use MWDOWN, MWUP for wheel mouse motion

 You can also use termcap string capability names.  For example:

	.ku		Up
	.kd		Down
	.kl		Left
	.kr		Right
	.kh		Home
	.kH		End
	.kI		Insert
	.kD		Delete
