Issues:

X Remove termcap search logic from joe
* Click on block should clear it
* Double click on unused space behaves oddly
* PuTTY should optimize scrolls and bitblt for quicker scrolling.  Cursor needs to be invalidated + many other screen update problems.
X Joe/Putty should both start up in utf-8 mode.
X Alt-enter should full-screen the editor
X Apply Aero-snap fix to putty.
X Make filenames unicode (utf-8).  Need to call into system wchar functions and convert input/output for filenames. (NOTE: wcstombs/mbstowcs)
X When saving "..\blah.txt", status display is "Saved ..blah.txt" -- assumes \ is escape char.
X On first save of "..\blah.txt", status line still shows the file as (Modified) -- the second save clears that.
X If saved coordinates off the screen on startup, recenter the window.
X Sometimes allocates too much memory for comm queue on startup.  Threads need to rendezvous to ensure both ends are ready for messages.
X If saved color file not in expected directory, "(Default)" gets automatically selected.

Backlog:

X Check stuff into SVN
X Get rid of unused PuTTY menu items.
  X About box to be fixed when we upgrade VS's (resources did not upgrade from 2k8)
X Windows environment
  X Create AppData dir when necessary.  Use to save .joe_state
  X Update joe to load joerc from program dir, install dir, and user appdata
    (in that order) -- didn't do install dir.  Shouldn't be an issue.
* Copy/Paste
  X Implement Windows cut, copy, and paste commands
  X Link paste to ^KC, link cut and copy to ^, and ^.
  X Implement copy/paste menu items in PuTTY context menu
* Hook into shell for opening/saving files
  * Interactive file dialog on shift-tab
  X Drag file to window: open
X Naming convention/coding standard refactor.
X RC file work (across all personalities)
  X Default to CRLF ending.
  X Remove hardcoded variables (use mouse, xterm 256, etc)
  X Fast status refresh
  * Create JoePad personality.
  * Control-left/Control-right (can be done through RC files)
  * Also shift-left/shift-right, shift-control-left/shift-control-right, etc..
  * Better keyboard shortcuts for copy/paste (currently ^S is copy)
X Behave better when user closes app through 'X'
  X Handle QUIT command on joe side
  X Data structure on PuTTY side to track open buffers in JOE
  X Send event notifications from joe when buffer states change.
  X Hook into quit and modify 'are you sure?' handling.
  X Extra: update window title with active file.
* Random improvements/Windows behavior
  * Detect and tweak auto-completion for UNC paths.
  * If invoked from install dir, then open 'My Documents' -- potentially
    track last used path.
  X Save/restore window size and placement.
  * Disable Linux/emacs locking behavior.  Replace with proper Windows file locking.
* Convert VIM color schemes
  X Build initial, functional converter
  X Cover C, Python
  * XML
  * HTML
  X Override files
* Color schemes
  X Load color scheme from INI files on PuTTY end (just map colors)
    from all standard locations (progdir, installdir, appdata).
  X Modify PuTTY to remap colors based on scheme
  X Modify JOE to load scheme info into syntax data structures
  X Hook color schemes into Windows menu
  X Add checkboxes for color schemes
  X Modify PuTTY to draw bold fonts on certain colors
  X Change joe drawing code to use special colors for status/selection
  * Italic fonts?
  X Save/load last used color scheme.
  X Send color scheme over to joe on startup.
  * Finish up custom colors for:
    * Menu selection
    * Status line
    * Prompt Windows
    * "-------" divider
  * Indicate currently selected line (totally new feature)
  * Indicate active buffer ala vim
  * Total revamp of jsf files to allow finer-grained color mapping
* In-program configurability
  * JOE settings:
    * Edit joerc file (or whatever current personality is)
    * Open user configuration directory
  * JOEWIN settings:
    X Change font
    X Change scheme
    X Change cursor type
X Reduce executable size
  X Merge UNICODE mapping data in PuTTY and JOE into one common store of information
  X Investigate whether JOE's builtin character maps can be taken care of through Win32 calls
X Fix input/output channel.  Remove winsock and replace with thread-safe queue.
* Rearrange build
  X Populate schemes and conf files to output as part of build.
  * Create script to build from command line.
* Housekeeping tasks
  X Pick a naming convention for common functions/defines/globals and use it consistently.
  X Rearrange directory structure to get rid of 'externals' and house syntax/conf/colors
    in a more consistent manner.
  X Pull as much out of joewin as possible.  Much of it could go into joewincommon.  Don't know
    if I need to keep the project around as a target for the DLL or not, but see if I can kill it.
  * Snap to a more recent version of PuTTY (it's been about two years).
* Executable reorganization
  X Make the main entry point a DLL and create an EXE for each personality.
  X Change the way resources are baked in: use real Windows resources instead of static strings.
  X Create standalone versions of each editor personality with some set of baked-in resources.
    X Separate output directories for these.
  * Create a ZIP file project that collects the main parts to a ZIP
  X Create a WiX project that generates an MSI (same stuff as ZIP)

Joe issues
* ^KH in search/replace prompt draws screen incorrectly. -- Repro's in JOE/Linux too.
* What is the boundary for large files?  A 3MB file took a while to load (though it was probably disk access slowing it down).
* ^[ shows up at top of screen too often (mouse moves, every non-alphanumeric)
* JOE doesn't recognize UTF-8 preamble
X Hex editor broken with file that has CRLF newlines, when editor is in CRLF mode (0d is hidden, causes weird jumps/numbering)
* Edit lines past width of screen stop showing text/don't scroll to the right (broken in Linux, too)
* Editor falls over with large files (tried with a 182M file).  It simply exits with no indication of an error.  Need to test this on Linux as well.  Seems to be a problem in vfiles but I haven't looked deep enough.
