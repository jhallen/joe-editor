Error parsing

Exit
----
cancel		Like abort, but doesn't return failure: useful in macros
		to escape out of a prompt.

abort		Abort current buffer/window.  Prompt if it is changed.

abortbuf	Like above, but just fail if it would have to prompt because
		it's the last window on a modified buffer.

ask		Prompt to save current file: user says yes return, user says
		no: run 'abort'.  Use in a macro: "ask,query,exsave"

exsave		Save file and exit

lose		emacs kill buffer.  The buffer is deleted- any windows with
		it get a replacement scratch buffer.

		Use in a macro: "querysave,query,killjoe"

killjoe		Exit joe immediately without checking for modified buffers

Misc
----
beep		Beep
execmd		Execute a joe command
math		Calculator
mode		Mode prompt
menu		Menu prompt
msg		Display a message
notmod		Clear the modified flag
retype		Refresh screen
shell		Suspend process or execute a sub-shell
stat		Display cursor position
tag		Tags file search
txt		Insert text.  If first character of entered text, then the rest
		of the text is treated as if it were a status line
		definition string, like -lmsg and -rmsg.

charset		Insert current character set
keymap		Switch to another keymap

Prompts
-------
complete	Complete a file-name in a prompt
if		Only run following cmds if expr is true (non-zero)
then		Same as rtn but only works in prompt windows
elsif		Try a new condition
else		Toggle truth flag
endif		Start running cmds again

Here is an example 'if' macro:

if,"char==65",then,"it's an A",else,"it's not an A",endif	^[ q

When you hit ^[ q, if the character under the cursor is an 'A': "it's a A"
is inserted into the buffer, otherwise "it's not an A" is inserted.

"if" creates a math prompt (like ESC m).  "then" is like "rtn"- it hits the
return key for this prompt.

Within the math prompt, the following variables are available:
	char	ASCII value of character under cursor
	width	Width of screen
	height	Height of screen
	byte	byte number
	col	column number
	line	line number
	lines	no. lines in file

	markv	True if there is a valid block set (^KB ... ^KK)
	rdonly	True if file is read-only
	arg	Current repeat argument
	argset	True if a repeat argument was given
	no_windows No. buffer windows on the screen

Commands:
	hex	Hex display mode
	dec	Decimal display mode
	ins	Insert 'ans' into buffer
	sum	Sum of numbers in block
	cnt	Count numbers in block
	avg	Average value of numbers in block
	dev	Standard deviation of numbers in block
	eval	Evaluate math expressions in block (or whole file
		if no block set).
	joe(..)	Execute a JOE macro (argument in same format
		as joerc file macros).  Return value of
		JOE macro is returned (for macro success,
		return true (non-zero)).

		For example:

			joe(sys,"[ 1 == 1 ]",rtn)

		([ 1 == 1 ]) is a shell command.  "[" is a synonym for
		the "test" UNIX command.

		Returns true.

		Remember: argument for JOE macro command
		"if" is a math expression.  So for example, the
		macro:

		if,"joe(sys,\"[ 1 == 1 ]\",rtn)",then,"TRUE",endif

		Types TRUE into the buffer.

Operators:
	
	^  * / %  + -  < <= > >= == !=  &&  ||  ? :  =  :

	&&, || and ? : work as in C and sh as far as side effects: if the
	left side of && is false, the right side is not evaluated.

	: is expression separator
